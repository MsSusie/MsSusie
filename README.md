- 👋 Hi, I’m @MsSusie.
- 👀 I’m interested in making the perfect carbonara dish, trying to beat the NY Times Crossword, camping, growing vegetables in my apartment, and playing board games like Qwirkle. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript and Python 3.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any new projects that can teach me new concepts in Python 3, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 
- 📫 I can be contacted by email: susannasms@yahoo.com.
